ex04 TODO
=====================

In this exercise you will experiment with the fixed-function lighting model. 
Everything you need is found at ex04.cpp. 
The GameLogic files contain player movement and aren't relevant.

Lighting properties are already defined for you in init()
Material properties are already defined for you in the drawing functions

1. Set states
First thing make the scene look more realistic by changing polygon mode to fill
and turning on the Z-Buffer algorithm. 

2. Set lights
There are 3 light sources which are already configured in init(). You need to
turn them on and position them. Each of the light sources needs to be specified  
according to a different coordinate system: 
	* Point light (GL_LIGHT2) in Object space (the jumping sphere drawn in drawObjects())
	* Spot light (GL_LIGHT1) in Eye space (located on the camera) 
	* Directed light (GL_LIGHT0) in World space (pointing down from the sky)

3. Final touches
Set the lighting model to have two sided lighting. Make the jumping sphere appear 
glowing using the the material's emission property.  Finally make sure the jumping 
light (GL_LIGHT2) doesn't affect the other objects drawn in drawObjects().
