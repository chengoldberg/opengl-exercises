ex03 TODO
=====================

In this exercise you will practice transformations and drawing quadrics with GLU. 
Everything you need is found at ex03.cpp. You can ignore the "GUI" functions 
for now.

1. Fractal Tree
In drawTreeRec() you should complete drawing the tree. See instructions how to 
implement a fractal tree in the slides. The properties defined by the user 
are available as:
	g_factor - determines the "shrinking" factor
	g_splits - determines the number of branches (2 - 2D, 3 - 3D...)
	g_angle - determines the angle between each child branch and his parent
	g_maxDepth - determines the number of levels in the tree

2. Camera
in setupCamera() implement the view transformation. Use the rotation information
found at g_rotX, g_rotY. These are updated by the mouse drag movement. That is 
left-clicking while moving the mouse anywhere on the window.
