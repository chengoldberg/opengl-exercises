=====================

In this exercise you will practice drawing in 3D.

1. Draw Cube
Draw the entire cube face by face in drawRGBCube(). For each face make sure its 
Front-side turns outwards. Color each vertex according to the RGB color space
Hint: similar to vertex positions in object space.

2. Multiple Cubes
Draw 3 cubes side by side using translation transformation. Before drawing each
one set front-face polygon mode to: points, lines and fill. Back-face polygons 
should be rendered as points. Set large point size and line width.
