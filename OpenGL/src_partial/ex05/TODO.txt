ex05 TODO
=====================

In this exercise you will practice the 3 accelerated drawing techniques in OpenGL.
All the code changes need to take place at Mesh.cpp & Mesh.h.

You need to implement the rendering of a mesh using each of the techniques.

The Mesh Class supports loading a simple mesh format (OFF). It stores
the vertices set in m_vertices, faces index set in m_faces. It 
calculates the normals for each vertex and stores it in m_normals.
It uses the Vec class for performing simple vector math.

It provides placeholders for each of the rendering methods. initialization functions:

	virtual void initDisplayList();
	virtual void initVertexArray();
	virtual void initVBO();

and render functions:

	virtual void renderImmediateMode();
	virtual void renderDisplayList();
	virtual void renderVertexArray();
	virtual void renderVBO();

The render() function calls whichever render mode is currently active (selected by F1-6 keys)	
The default render mode, Immediate mode, is already implemented. You must implement all the rest.

Finally, be sure to enable back-face culling in ex05.cpp init().
