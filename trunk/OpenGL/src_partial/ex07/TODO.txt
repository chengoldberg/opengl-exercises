ex07 TODO
=====================

In this exercise you will practice using the stencil buffer.
ex07 contains all the code you will need to change.

The world contains a few objects: Floor, Grass, Mirror, Mirror border and some various geometrical shapes.
You need to render a mirror of the world along the XZ plane, and make it 
visible only through the mirror. 

1. Mirror
The world is drawn with the function drawWorld(). You should call it twice from
display(): once regularly and once flipped. Before the second pass be sure 
to set the stencil in the shape of the mirror using drawMirror(). 
The reflected world should also contain the actor, drawn using drawActor().

2. Shadow
You should project all objects to the XZ plane in respect to the sun's position C.
Since the sun is in infinity then the projection is orthographic and the 
projection matrix that performs this is:
	
		    1    ,-Cx/Cy,0    ,0
		T = 0    ,0     ,0    ,0
		    0    ,-Cz/Cy,1    ,0
		    0    ,0     ,0    ,1		    
			
You should take the shadow of all the objects in the scene except for the sun:
		
	drawMirrorBorder();
	drawMirror();
	drawObjects();
	drawActor();
	drawGrass();

To draw the floor in ambient (needed for the shadow pass) call drawFloor() with 
GL_LIGHT0 disabled.
