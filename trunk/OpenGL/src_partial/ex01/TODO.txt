ex01 TODO
=====================

In this exercise you will practice changing states and basic drawing.

1. Changing States
Change OpenGL states to get a result similar to the image. All the changes
you need to do are marked with "//TODO:". You only need to edit display().

2. Drawing
Look at the drawing functions and create new ones yourself or change them.
Then edit drawTriangle() to make it rotate on the Y-axis over time. You can
perform the rotation using the 2D function:

	x = cos(alpha)*x - sin(alpha)*y
	y = sin(alpha)*x + cos(alpha)*y
	
You can make it spin over time by using g_frame variable which is incremented
every 16 milliseconds.
